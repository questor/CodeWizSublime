# CodeWizSublime
Sublime Text plugin for C++ programmers

provides some functions available to old versions of visual studio via the codewiz plugin:
- special copy'n'paste: you can select a function in a header file, switch to implementation and paste the methods already with classname and 'virtual' and 'static' commented
- the same can be done with functions in implementation files back to headers
- you can switch from a function name to the declaration of this function/implementation of this function

default key map is:
- ctrl+alt+q: special copy
- ctrl+alt+w: special paste
- alt+shift+o: switch friend method

please note: I've looked at many other plugins how to implemente this one, so credits need to go mostly to others, I have only assembled the pieces...
